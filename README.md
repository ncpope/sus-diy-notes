# This project is a collection of my personal notes from our own Startup School DIY group

Our group was formed after our experiene with startup school. I enjoyed my experience and wanted to continue the experience. Our company, and our customers in turn, recieved a lot of great value.

I will be updating my notes weekly here. They are the points that I found helpful or wanted to bring up in our weekly meetings.

## How does it work?

Over the course of 10 weeks a group of founders meets and discusses their progress over the previous week in regards to a single key measurement. Each founder gets to choose their own metric and the more common ones are: Daily Active Users, New Revenue, Number of Sales Calls Made, Total Installs etc.
