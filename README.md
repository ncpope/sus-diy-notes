# This project is a collection of my personal notes from our DIY Startup School group

Our group was formed after our experience with startup school. I enjoyed my experience and wanted to continue it. Our company, and our customers in turn, recieved a lot of great value.

I will be updating my notes weekly here. It includes the points that I found helpful or wanted to discuss in our weekly meetings.

## How does it work?

Over the course of 10 weeks a group of founders meets and discusses their progress over the previous week in regards to a single key measurement. Based on my personal experience the ideal range is at least 4 and at most 10.

Each founder gets to choose their own metric to measure for the duration. The more common ones are: Daily Active Users, New Revenue, Number of Sales Calls Made, Total Installs etc.

The key is to pick a the most important metric for your company and to stick to it for the entire duration. This helps when making prioritizing tasks and responsibilities. Do the things that most affect this single metric.
