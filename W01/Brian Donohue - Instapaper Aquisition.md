# Interesting story about how he started as a developer and became the CEO

Had a hypothesis about how they could compete against their free competitors.

Switched the pricing model to compete with free competitors. - Difficult to convince the management becuase 40 - 70% of revenue was being generated by paid app installs.

Reached out to apple to get positioned into a featured "Free app of the week" position to test their hypothesis

The hypothesis turned out to be correct, they received more downloads that week than they had in the previous 2 years combined.

The revenue took a hit for 6 - 8 months as they had anticipate then it returned to a growth trajectory.
