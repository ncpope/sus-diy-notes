If its heading home to a port or winning a race

# building a company is so much like racing a sailboat

    you need a plan
    ability to re-evaluate a new plan as the situation changes
    you need to let go of your self doubt
    the race wont wait for you
    the selection of your crew is paramount

It's impossible to be an effective skipper if you dont have the right crew

A startup has a better chance of success when there are less founders
too many cooks spoil the broth

it's essential to get a right mix of the right ingredients

it's essential to market and design a major inovation in a way that makes its adoption non disruptive

that makes it easy to integrate with an established order

if a puzzle cant be solved one way there is always another way, its just a matter of navigation

its about never taking your eye off of creating value for partners or customers

as a company founder you enjoy building things

you may lose this race or the next one
