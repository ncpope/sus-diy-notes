# 9 Ways to Build Virality into your Product - Gabor Cselle

`If your startup is building a consumer product, your product has to be viral.`

# Two-Sided Reward

`By letting me choose which of the options I send to my friend, my attention is redirected from fears of spamming them, to finding something that they would like`

# Appeal to Vanity

`This battle created a lot of free publicity for Twitter, as both Ashton and CNN used their media power to blast out requests for followers. Users would sign up for Twitter, and then immediately follow one or both of them, thus populating their feeds with interesting and relevant content.`

# Collaboration

`Apps built for collaboration or communication between coworkers are inherently viral. `

# Artifacts Shared on Social

`If your product creates uniquely interesting content, users can be encouraged to share it on their social networks, thus spreading knowledge of your product to their network`
