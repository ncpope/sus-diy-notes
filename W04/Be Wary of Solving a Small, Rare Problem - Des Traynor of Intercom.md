onboarding people one by one

"here is what intercom could look like in your product, would you like to try it?"

did a lot of content marketing to people who ran startups with topics that were interesting to them then they would occasionally pitch intercom to them

shifted between roles throughout his time at intercom

    started with creating the product team
    moved into customer support and grew that team
    is now focusing on growing by using marketing

Think about the journey the customer takes

    curious about the general concept
    emphasise why something related to the core of the product is important to them
    show how your product can solve this issue and make them want it right now

It's important to think about the problem holisticaly

the person looking for the solution your product solves may not know the correct terminology to search for

selling someone the solution before they realize the problem is pointless

"build what you sell, sell what you build" if youre not doing both of those things youre in trouble

treating hire #66 the same as #4 is a totally different process

you may need to find the problem on your own before someone elses solution can make sense to you

books for management

    managing humans
    the hard thing about hard things

"to have everyone on the same page, you need a page"

*"does you product match a big problem or a frequent problem or ideally, a big / frequent problem"?*

its hard to sell a brand that has a high degree of specificity and its hard to sell a brand that has a high degree of ambiguity

as startups grow you move from swiss army knives to scalpels
