# Cindy Mi: Founder of Vip Kid
Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoffBerre24&t=910s

*co-founded english training school at 17 with her uncle*
*started with lean startup mentality, rented a single classroom in the middle of nowhere*

    learned lessons slowly:
    how to increase enrollments one by one
    learned what each student wants and what the parents want

learning about the students & parents was important since the students werent the ones buying the platform, the parents were. However, the students are the ones using the platform.

# How to convince your team that you can win in a very competitive market?

Chinese parents value education as investments
15% of household income goes towards education, vs. 2% in the US

## After 15 years of education experience she discovered a lot of painpoints

- there are a low number of english teachers in China
- getting content is that hardest part
- learning every day is better for picking up a language vs. doing it one time per week
- parents prefer if their children can learn at home so that they don't have extra commute to bring the kids to a language school
- decided to build a global classroom connecting different cultures

*texas is the largest source of teachers for VIP kid*

for the early days of vip kid what metrics did you use to find product-market-fit?

- a year and a half to find product market fit
- efficiency, engagement, efficacy ( test scores )
- consumed time on the platform ( how much progress have they made? )
- does the student come back every week?
- does the parent refer the program to other parents?
- started with four students (MVP)
- month over month added 10 students around 200 after the year and a half

*need to guarantee the quality for both teachers and students*

YC always advocates for building something that your users want

many enterprises start with a small number of users, don't focus on being small - focus on building something that your users want

*how do you find the business model and make sure that it is viable?*

create higher value for all users of the platform

parents/students:
it's essential to bring value to all sides (students, parents, and teachers)
lowered the cost of learning for parents by around 50%
it's impossible to find a teacher to come to your house for only half an hour
50-60% less than they would have to pay for offline learning
teachers are of a higher quality than what you can find in China
you previously couldn't choose a teacher, it's now a more personalized experience for the students

teachers:
generally 16$ per hour of tutoring students
willing to teach a global student audience
many teachers are female and are stay at home moms for a few years
teachers help supplement a families income (what options do you have in salt lake city)
no commute
higher pay $20 per hour

*focus on real value creation on all sides*

# mistakes

- tried to build too much for the platform
- understand that there are limited resources
- some of the work they planned on four years ago still hasn't been completed
- unable to scale (2000 parents signed up one day and it took them 3 months to return the call)
- everyone becomes a customer service rep even engineers

# expanding

- have almost 10,000 employees now
- expanding from english into other languages
- expanding from 1 on 1 to 1 on 4

*the goal is to build a global classroom*

a global company from day one

with their teacher community they were global from day one

she flew to major us cities and canada to find teachers in person, three months in total

community / team success factors

your team needs to consider timezones for a global product

- teachers need to trust the brand, thats why they created a teacher success team in the states

personalization & empowerment
how can we find the most engaging teachers for the child?
how can we make sure that the teacher engages with the child in a way that is most effective for the child?

common traits between good teachers (passion)

allow the teacher to make more impact using AI

technology should be able to transform almost everything we do as a society

focus on the specific scenarios where you can improve using technology

AI is a rapid way of aquiring knowledge

understand fundamentally how a person learns

can we pair the techology with passionate innovators?
