around 4 months time period - at the crossroads

should they keep it as a side project / get vc?

*am i ever going to have the time in my life where it is starting to show some traction?*

a lot of what worked on the growth side initially was manual messaging - let me do that more often

discourage vc funding if they are making money - if you can support yourself indefinitely

software does not need to be a startup - it could be a successful small business

wirecutter did a friends and family round and are now valued at 30M

if they raised money the product would change dramnatically

*you dont need any money to build anything*

_not all companies that are successful need to raise money_

its better to work with a great firm now and raise less now, rather then wait for a less good firm and raise more later down the road

    retention
    growth
    revenue

if youre going to pivot then do something youre a deep expert in

micro decision have big effect

redeigns are a trap

people dont care about whether or not a button is shinier or not

*i could work on a redesign for a month or i could optimize my sales funnel and make more money*
